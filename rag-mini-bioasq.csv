"New data on viruses isolated from patients with subacute thyroiditis de Quervain 
are reported. Characteristic morphological, cytological, some physico-chemical 
and biological features of the isolated viruses are described. A possible role 
of these viruses in human and animal health disorders is discussed. The isolated 
viruses remain unclassified so far."
"We describe an improved method for detecting deficiency of the acid hydrolase, 
alpha-1,4-glucosidase in leukocytes, the enzyme defect in glycogen storage 
disease Type II (Pompe disease). The procedure requires smaller volumes of blood 
and less time than previous methods. The assay involves the separation of 
leukocytes by Peter's method for beta-glucosidase and a modification of Salafsky 
and Nadler's fluorometric method for alpha-glucosidase."
"We have studied the effects of curare on responses resulting from iontophoretic 
application of several putative neurotransmitters onto Aplysia neurons. These 
neurons have specific receptors for acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine, octopamine, 
phenylethanolamine, histamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), aspartic acid, 
and glutamic acid. Each of these substances may on different specific neurons 
elicit at least three types of response, caused by a fast depolarizing Na+, a 
fast hyperpolarizing Cl-, or a slow hyperpolarizing K+ conductance increase. All 
responses resulting from either Na+ or Cl- conductance increases, irrespective 
of which putative transmitter activated the response, were sensitive to curare. 
Most were totally blocked by less than or equal to 10-4 M curare. GABA responses 
were less sensitive and were often only depressed by 10-3 M curare. K+ 
conductance responses, irrespective of the transmitter, were not curare 
sensitive. These results are consistent with a model of receptor organization in 
which one neurotransmitter receptor may be associated with any of at least three 
ionophores, mediating conductance increase responses to Na+, Cl-, and K+, 
respectively. In Aplysia nervous tissue, curare appears not to be a specific 
antagonist for the nicotinic ACh receptor, but rather to be a specific blocking 
agent for a class of receptor-activated Na+ and Cl- responses."
"Kinetic and electrophoretic properties of 230--300 fold purified preparations of 
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) from red cells of donors and patients 
with acute drug hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency were studied. A new 
abnormal variant of G6PD isolated from red cell of a patient with acute drug 
hemolytic anemia, which was not described in literature, has been discovered. 
The abnormal enzyme differs from the normal by decreased Michaelis constant for 
glucose-6-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), by 
increased utilization of analogues of substrates--2-deoxy-glucose-6-phosphate 
and particularly deamino-NADP, by low thermal stability, by the character of 
pH-dependence, by the appearance of a single band of G6PD activity in 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
"Male Wistar specific-pathogen-free rats aged 2, 7, 17, 30, 60, 120, 200, 360 and 
600 days, all killed in experiment on the same day, were examined. The body 
weight significantly increased until the 200th day, the weight of adrenals until 
the 120th day and the adrenal protein content until the 30th day of life. The 
adrenaline content of the adrenals increased continuously during the 600 days 
studied. Adrenal noradrenaline content increased rapidly over the first 17 days, 
remained at a stable level until the 120th day, and rose to a higher level after 
200 days. The activity of adrenal catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes also 
increased with age: tyrosine hydroxylase gradually increased until the 360th 
day, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase until 
the 200th day. Our results demonstrate that, in the rat, during development 
there is a gradual increase of adrenal weight, adrenaline content, tyrosine 
hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase activity until 
maturation (120th day), whereas the adrenal noradrenaline content reaches the 
adult values earlier, around the 17th day. During aging, adrenal catecholamines 
significantly increase when compared to young-adult rats (120-day-old), probably 
due to the elevated activity of the adrenal catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes. 
The increased adrenal catecholamine levels in old animals might be connected 
with a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases in aged."
"Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) 
activities were assayed in adrenal glands of the following groups of the Alaskan 
red-backed vole (Clethrionomys rutilus dawsoni): 1) laboratory reared at 20 
degrees C and 2) exposed to 5 degrees C for 1, 3, 7, and 28 days; 3) wild, 
summer acclimatized; 4) wild, fall acclimatized; and 5) wild, winter 
acclimatized. TH activity in laboratory-acclimated voles exposed to 5 degrees C 
was increased by 2 times after 3 days and remained elevated after 28 days. PNMT 
activity in these same voles was increased after 7 days and also remained 
elevated after 28 days of cold exposure. In wild-acclimatized voles TH activity 
and PNMT activity in summer were equivalent to levels in 28-day cold-acclimated 
laboratory voles. In fall, TH activity was increased to 2.5 times the summer 
value. It decreased by midwinter, but remained elevated above the summer level. 
In contrast, PNMT activity appeared unchanged from summer through fall and 
winter. Pregnant summer voles had markedly increased TH activity. Adrenal 
norepinephrine and epinephrine did not change significantly with cold 
acclimation or seasonal acclimatization. Thus, acclimatization of wild voles to 
fall and winter conditions involved aquisition of a greater capacity to 
synthesize adrenal catecholamines than that produced by exposing 
laboratory-reared voles to an extended period of cold."
"Hemolytic anemia is a well-recognized complication of sulfasalazine treatment. 
17 of 40 (43%) patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving sulfasalazine 
had evidence of hemolysis as detected by starch gel electrophoresis. Only 47% 
(8) of patients with hemolysis had Heinz body formation. The hemoglobin was 
significantly reduced in patients with hemolysis and 53% had a reticulocyte 
count of greater than 5%. A significant correlation was noted between hemolysis 
and serum sulfapyridine level, but no correlation was seen with serum 
sulfasalazine level. There was no significant difference in disease extent or 
activity in patients with hemolysis compared to those without hemolysis. 
Hemolysis is not a rare side-effect of sulfasalazine therapy. Heinz body 
formation is not invariably found in sulfasalazine-induced hemolysis."
"(1) The RNA replicase induced by bacteriophage Qbeta consists of four 
non-identical subunits designated as alpha (mol. wt. 74000), beta (mol. wt. 
64000), gamma (mol. wt. 47000) and delta (mol. wt. 33000), only one (subunit 
beta) of which is specified by the phage genome. (2) Subunit alpha (30 S 
ribosomal protein ""S1"" as well as translational interference factor ""i"") is 
required only for (+) strand-directed RNA synthesis in the presence of the host 
factor. (3) Qbeta replicase lacking subunit alpha (R-alpha) is capable of 
replicating templates other than (+) strand, such as (--), ""6S"" RNA, poly(C) 
etc., in the absence of the host factor. (4) Subunit beta is suggested to be the 
nucleotide-polymerizing enzyme, but is unable to initiate RNA synthesis by 
itself. (5) Subunits gamma and delta are identical to the protein synthesis 
elongation factors, EF-Tu and EF-Ts, respectively, and are required only for 
initiation of RNA synthesis, but not for elongation. (6) A model of Qbeta 
replicase is presented in order to discuss observed template-enzyme 
interactions."
"Mice were inoculated with human sarcoid tissue homogenates or with a first or a 
second passage homogenate of mouse tissue (including 0.2 mum membrane filtrates) 
originating from the inoculation of human sarcoid, Crohn's disease, or control 
tissue homogenates. Epithelioid and giant cell granulomas were present in the 
footpads and/or viscera of some of the mice given homogenates originating from 
each sarcoid or Crohn's disease tissue 15 months after inoculation but were not 
present in mice given control homogenates. Among mice given homogenates 
originating from human sarcoidosis, granulomas were present in many organs and 
tissues; in contrast, a pattern of selective dissemination of visceral 
granulomas was found among mice given homogenates originating from Crohn's 
disease. This differential distribution of visceral granulomas also followed the 
inoculation of 0.2 mum membrane filtrates. Granulomatous responses at Kveim test 
sites in the ear 9-17 months after inoculation of homogenatesoriginating from 
human sarcoidosis or Crohn's disease were confined to mice showing granulomas in 
footpads of viscera. The ability of the transmissible agents to induce 
granulomas in mice was destroyed when sarcoid or Crohn's tissues were autoclaved 
or when sarcoid homogenates were stored at -20degreesC for 1 week or exposed to 
60Co irradiation (2.5 MR)."
"Bleomycin is potentially capable of inducing a diffuse interstitial fibrosis of 
the lung, the pathogenesis of which has not yet been elucidated. The authors 
have demonstrated that after 48 hr of acute treatment, morphological and 
functional modifications could be seen in type II pneumocytes, which are 
responsible for surfactant production. This might be the earliest stage of 
pulmonary damage."
"Galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase cross reacting material was demonstrated 
in brain, liver, and skin fibroblasts from patients with Krabbe disease. The 
mutant enzyme was antigenically identical to the normal enzyme and exhibited 
similar electrophoretic mobility. Normal quantities of the catalytically 
deficient enzyme were measured in the patients' tissues by a sensitive single 
radial immunodiffusion assay, indicating that the mutation is in structural gene 
for the enzyme protein."
"Pathological features of twenty-one cases of malignant melanoma studied in the 
University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu during the period January, 1974 
to December, 1975 are presented. Malignant melanoma accounted for 2.4% of all 
tumours and 4.5% of all malignant tumours, greatest age incidence being in the 
fifth to seventh decades. The male to female sex ratio was 2:1. 73.2% of cases 
were of the nodular variety. 81% melanomas occurred on the sole of feet 
validating the hypothesis that the pigmented skin in Africans is resistant to 
malignant melanoma. Melanoma in Nigerians would appear essentially to be arising 
from epidermal melanocytes and not from preexisting naevus cells. Hence we do 
not feel prophylactic removal of plantar moles as suggested by Onuigbo (1975) is 
desirable. Histologically, there was no clear association between the cell types 
and the kind of melanoma or invasion of the tumour. The difference in behaviour 
and natural history of malignant melanoma would appear to have a bearing on the 
local tissue and also general immune mechanisms of the host."
"Eucaryotic and procaryotic organisms differ in two aspects of their translation 
machinery: polycistronic messengers are expressed as a sequence of individual 
proteins only in procaryotes, and the initiation of protein synthesis proceeds 
with an initiator tRNA which is found to be modified (formylated) in procaryotes 
and not in eucaryotes. In the present study, we show that formylation is 
required in vivo for the coordinate expression of the Escherichia coli lactose 
operon. Our experiments are consistent with a translation mechanism using 
dissociated ribosomes at the 5' end of the mRNA in a reaction that is only 
weakly dependent on formylation at this initiation step; the ribosomes then 
travel along the messenger and can reinitiate after the intracistronic barrier 
without dissociation. This latter initiation step is strongly dependent on the 
level of formylation: a low level of the formyl group, obtained by the antifolic 
agent trimethoprim, induces a strong polarity in the expression of the lactose 
operon. There exist mutant strains in which this polarity is much less apparent 
than in the wild type. We show here that such is the case of rpsL mutants. 
Ribosomes mutated in the S12 protein (rpsL) are found to be much more easily 
dissociated than the wild type. This might explain why the expression of the 
lactose operon on rpsL strains remains coordinated when the intracellular level 
of formylation is decreased."
"Using somatic cell hybrids from fusions of lymphocytes of two different mouse 
stocks with the myeloma cell line X63-Ag8, we have assigned genes for the 
immunoglobulin heavy and kappa-type light chains to chromosomes 12 and 6, 
respectively. The two mouse stocks exhibit karyotypes consisting of nine pairs 
of metacentric chromosomes as a result of centric fusions of acrocentric 
chromosomes in different combinations. In the hybrid cells these metacentric 
chromosomes can be distinguished from the acrocentric chromosomes of myeloma 
origin, permitting correlation of Ig chain expression with mitotic loss of 
individual metacentric chromosomes."
"Review of the data is presented on the hereditary disease gangliosidosis GM1 and 
on the enzyme beta-galactosidose, deficiency of which is responsible for this 
disease. Heterogeneity of the disease and existence of various forms of 
beta-galactosidase are considered. Possible correlation is discussed between the 
defects of the enzyme forms detected and the type of the disease."
"The authors have attempted to demonstrate the effect of bilateral adrenalectomy 
on carrageenin-induced oedema and on the antiphlogistic action of phenylbutazone 
in relation to the changes of blood 5-hydroxtryptamine (5-HT) in rats of 
different ages (21 days, 42 days, 3 months and 18 months old). It was found that 
the influence of adrenalectomy on the antiphlogistic action of phenylbutazone 
and on the blood 5-HT concentration is related to the age of rats. The lowest 
antiphlogistic action of phenylbutazone was found in 21-day-old rats and highest 
in the 18-month-old ones. In adrenalectomized 21- and 42-day-old rats the 
antiphlogistic action is decreased and fully suppressed in rats 3 and 18 months 
old. Adrenalectomy does not influenced basal values of blood 5-HT concentration. 
Blood 5-HT in adrenalectomized rats with inflammationadrenalectomized rats 42 
days and 3 months old with inflammation after injection of phenylbutazone an 
increase of 5-HT was observed, but in 18-month-old animals in which 
antiphlogistic action is highest a decrease of 5-HT was observed."
"A report of a patient with granulomatous peritonitis following general surgery 
is presented. Laparoscopy was performed as the final diagnostic procedure. 
Prevention is the remedy for this iatrogenic problem."
"4103 cases suspected of mycoses were analysed as to sex, age and site of disease 
and 3891 were proved cases. This group formed 50% of total mycoses or 13-93% of 
all dermatoses recorded in the Government General Hospital, Madras, during the 
period of study. There were 66-26% adult female, 27-6% adult male and 6-14% were 
below 13 years. Dermatophytoses were found in 73-5%; the other common diseases 
were tinea versicolor (17-68%) and candidiasis (12-43%). Multiple sites of 
involvement or more than 1 disease in the same individual were mostly observed. 
The incidence of piedra (0-1%) and deep mycoses (0-156%) was very low. Mycetoma 
was the common disease (5/6) in deep mycoses. In dermatophytoses, tinea corporis 
(49-71%) and tinea cruris (47-85%) commonest; tinea axillaris (3-42%), tinea 
capitis (1-72%) and tinea barbae (1-29%) were less common. The incidence of 
tinea manuum, tinea pedis and tinea unguium was similar (4-97%-6-38%). High 
temperature and humidity were related to the higher incidence of tinea corporis, 
tinea cruris and tinea versicolor. Mainly children suffered from tinea capitis. 
All other mycoses were commonly found in adults between 2nd and 3rd decades. In 
all mycoses but candidiasis, female predominated. Cutaneous candidiasis was 
mainly a problem of housewives. Among the dermatophytes Trichophyton violaceum 
was predominant (33-7%) followed by T. rubrum (32-6%). Trichophyton schoenleinii 
and M. gypseum were rarely isolated. From mycetoma, Madurella mycetomii, 
Nocardia braziliensis, N. asteroides and Actinomadura spp. were isolated. 
Demonstration of Cryptococcus laurentii in 1 case is reported in this area for 
the first time."
"This paper reports about a female mutational falsetto, that means an unusual 
high (309 Hz base frequency) fundamental frequency of the speaking voice in a 
19-year-old girl. The psychological background and the epicrisis as well as the 
practical negative result of the hormon- and metabolism examination allow the 
diagnosis of this rare disturbance of the voice, the formal classification of 
which would on the other hand also allow the statement of a phononeurosis with a 
too high fundamental frequency of the speaking voice because the behavior of the 
voice from the menarche (12 years) up to the first examination does not seem 
assured definately. The individual median fundamental frequency of the speaking 
voice has inally been obtained at 270 Hz. Energy range of the speaking voice has 
been measured, glottography and sonagraphy has been carried out, all of which 
show the course of treatment clearly. It has been remarked critically that there 
has to be found a method to better reproduce the hearing impression in a figure. 
Investigations according to this have been made."
"Animal experiments suggest that opiate peptides might play a role in 
extrapyramidal function. This hypothesis was tested by administering the opiate 
antagonist, naltrexone, in doses sufficient to antagonize exogenous opiates, to 
patients with parkinsonism and Huntington's disease. No improvement in the 
clinical features of either disorder was noted."
"Certain drugs are transformed into reactive metabolites by cytochrome P-450, a 
hepatic microsomal enzyme. The reactive metabolites covalently bind to 
hepatocyte macromolecules, thus determining liver lesions. Induction of 
microsomial enzymes increases the formation of reactive metabolites and 
exaggerates hepatotoxicity of these drugs."
"Protein methylase III (S-adenosylmethionine:proteinlysine methyltransferase; ED 
2.1.1.25) and protein methylase I (S-adenosylmethionine:protein-arginine 
methyltransferase; EC 2.1.1.23) activities were examined in isolated nuclei and 
cytosol fraction, respectively, from various hepatomas with different growth 
rates. The enzyme activities of both enzymes paralleled the rates of tumor 
growth in fast- and moderately growing hepatomas. The parallelism was more 
evident with protein methylase I than with protein methylase III. While protein 
methylase III activity was elevated in the fast- to moderately growing 
hepatomas, the enzyme that is responsible for demethylating proteins, 
epsilon-alkyllysinase (epsilon-slkyl-L-lysine:oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 
1.5.3.4), had an inverse relationship to the rate of tumor growth, thus 
suggesting a possible physiological antagonism. When isolated rat liver nuclei 
were methylated in vitro with S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-14 C]methionine as methyl 
donor, H2SO4-insoluble protein and histones had almost equal amounts of 
methyl-14 C incorporated. However, amino acid analysis revealed that methylated 
arginines are the predominant form of radioactivity in the H2SO4-insoluble 
protein (product of protein methylase I), while methylated lysines are the major 
methylated amino acids in the histones (product of protein methylase III). 
Furthermore, the hydrolysate of the H2SO4-insoluble protein showed four unknown 
radioactivity peaks on the amino acid analyzer in addition to the known 
methylated arginine and lysine derivatives."
"The thyrotropin receptor from bovine thyroid plasma membranes has been 
solubilized using lithium diiodosalicylate, and an assay to measure thyrotropin 
binding to the solubilized receptor has been developed. Both the solubilized 
thyrotropin receptor and the thyrotropin receptor on thyroid plasma membranes 
have effectively identical nonlinear Scatchard plots and negatively sloped Hill 
plots, i.e. both preparations have receptors which appear to exhibit a similar 
negatively cooperative relationship. Although the pH optimum of thyrotropin 
binding to the solubilized receptor is the same as that of the thyroid plasma 
membrane receptor, pH 6.0, the pH dependency curve of the solubilized receptor 
is slightly different in its outline. Thyrotropin binding to the solubilized 
receptor is less sensitive to salt inhibition than is binding to the thyroid 
plasma membrane receptor; however, optimal binding remains at 0 degrees. The 
relative affinities of thyrotropin and two glycoprotein hormones which can be 
considered structural analogs, luteinizing hormone and human chorionic 
gonadotropin, are 100:10:5, respectively, toward plasma membrane receptors, but 
100:25:40 toward the solubilized receptors. The solubilized receptor preparation 
is heterogeneous in size in that it has binding components with molecular 
weights of 286,000, 160,000, 75,000, and 15,000 to 30,000. Tryptic digestion 
converts all three higher molecular weight components to the 15,000 to 30,000 
molecular weight species, and the 15,000 to 30,000 molecular weight receptor 
component has all of the binding properties of the solubilized receptor 
preparation before tryptic digestion including an identical nonlinear Scatchard 
plot. It has the same size as and coelutes from Sephadex G-100 with a 15,000 to 
30,000 molecular weight receptor released by tryptic digestion of bovine thyroid 
plasma membranes or tryptic digestion of bovine or dog thyroid cells in culture. 
The tryptic fragment of the solubilized receptor or preparations has been 
purified almost 250-fold by affinity chromatography on thyrotropin-Sepharose 
columns. The binding activity is lost when the solubilized thyrotropin receptor 
preparation is exposed to beads of neuraminidase-Sepharose or conconavalin 
A-Sepharose."
"The results of various in vitro analyses indicate there is an active immune 
response against antigens associated with human malignancies. This immune 
response apparently can be augmented by nonspecific immunologic stimulates such 
as BCG. These agents are effective for destroying tumor when injected locally 
into intracutaneous disease but are not as effective for subcutaneous disease. 
Preliminary clinical trials indicated that immune stimulants are effective when 
administered systemically. The effect is only minimal for diseminated disease, 
but the therapeutic benefit is clearly augmented for patients with a minimal 
residual tumor burden, such as those patients with metastases to regional lymph 
nodes. Thus immunotherapy is a systemically active mode of therapy. Its toxicity 
is minimal, and it appears to be effective in a wide spectrum of the disease. 
However, immunotherapy is not effective for a large residual tumor burden; 
consequently it must be used in combination with other modes of treatment such 
as irradiation therapy or chemotherapy. Early experiences with BCG immunotherapy 
for malignant melanoma and C. parvum for oat cell carcinoma are encouraging. It 
is remarkable that a nonspecific immunologic stimulant does, in fact, have this 
effect. Immunotherapy experiments in animals suggest that in order to achieve 
maximal benefit. BCG must have close contact with tumor cells or must be 
combined with a tumor-associated antigen. If these principles are true for man, 
it would seem that improvements for nonspecific immunotherapy in human neoplasms 
would be further augmented if a tumor-related antigen could be extracted from 
human tumours and combined with a nonspecific immunologic stimulant."
"Previous studies have shown that cultured fibroblasts derived from patients with 
genetic defects in lysosomal acid lipase (i. e. the Wolman Syndrome and 
Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease) are defective in their ability to hydrolyze 
the cholesteryl esters contained in plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL). As a 
result, these mutant cells show a reduced responsiveness to the regulatory 
actions of LDL, as evidenced by a decreased LDL-mediated suppression of the 
activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and by a decreased 
LDL-mediated activation of cellular cholesteryl ester formation. In the current 
studies, the Wolman Syndrome and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease cells were 
grown in the same Petri dish with mutant fibroblasts derived from a patient with 
the homozygous form of Familial Hypercholesterolemia. Whereas pure monolayers of 
either the Familial Hypercholesterolemia cells (lacking cell surface LDL 
receptors) or the acid lipase-deficient cells (lacking cholesteryl ester 
hydrolase activity) responded poorly to LDL, the mixed monolayers developed 
lipoprotein responsiveness as measured by an enhancement of both LDL-mediated 
suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and 
LDL-mediated stimulation of cholesteryl ester formation. This effect was shown 
to result from the release of the lysosomal acid lipase from the Familial 
Hypercholesterolemia homozygote cells into the culture medium and its subsequent 
uptake by the acid lipase-deficient cells. The acquisition of this acid lipase 
activity enhanced the ability of the Wolman Syndrome and Cholesteryl Ester 
Storage Disease cells to respond to the lipoprotein by suppression of 
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and activation of cellular 
cholesteryl ester formation. These data emphasize the importance of the 
lysosomal acid lipase in the cellular metabolism of LDL cholesteryl esters and, 
in addition, demonstrate that delivery of this enzyme to genetically deficient 
cells can enhance the regulatory response to the lipoprotein."
"Addition of exogen DB-c AMP in medium of human fibroblasts culture, with 46 XX 
karyotypes, enables us to observe a high frequency of Barr bodies, about 80 or 
85%. This observation suggests that the condensation of the X chromosome in the 
form of Barr bodies depends on the level of endogen cyclic AMP."
"Nine active neurohypophyseal principles have been isolated and identified among 
the vertebrates. Arginine-vasotocin is the most ubiquitous, occurring in 
pituitary glands from representatives of all the major vertebrate groups. There 
is much more variation in structure among the principles that resemble oxytocin. 
The manner in which these evolved remains unclear. Arginine-vasotocin stimulates 
smooth muscles from a wide variety of vertebrate species. It can stimulate 
contraction of oviducts from many jawed fishes and tetrapods. The oxytocin-like 
peptides are usually less active in this respect. Among adult mammals 
arginine-vasotocin is replaced by arginine-vasopressin which has much less 
oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts 
and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic 
functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals. 
Arginine-vasotocin elicits vasoconstrictor responses in even the most primitive 
vertebrates. These may be systemic or regional. Their distribution may determine 
whether arginine-vasotocin acts as a diuretic or an antidiuretic agent. It is 
possible that the most primitive neurohypophyseal functions were related to 
cardiovascular regulation and that the neurohypophysis acquired its 
osmoregulatory functions later in vertebrate evolution."
"A protein methylase III responsible for specifically methylating the cytochrome 
c in Neurospora crassa was partially characterized by using unmethylated horse 
heart cytochrome c as a substrate. This enzyme utilizes S-adenosyl-L-methionine 
as the methyl donor. An analysis of the distribution of [14C]methyl groups in 
the peptides obtained by chymotrypsin digestion of the enzymically methylated 
cytochrome c showed that all of the radioactivity could be recovered within a 
single peak after chromatography. This indicates that the enzyme methylates a 
specific amino acid sequence within cytochrome c. On hydrolysis of the 
radioactive chymotryptic peptide, Me-14C-labelled epsilon -N-mono-methyl-lysine, 
epsilon-N-dimethyl-lysine and epsilon-N-trimethyl-lysine were identified. The 
enzyme can easily be extracted from the N. crassa mycelial pads and was purified 
approx. 30-fold."
"De novo purine biosynthesis has been studied in lymphocyte cell lines 
established from Lesch-Nyhan patients deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine 
phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), in in vitro differentiating erythroleukaemic 
cell lines cloned from cells charactistic of virus-induced murine leukaemia, and 
in mutant hamster cells deficient in amidophosphoribosyltransferase. The 
relationship between cellular phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PP-ribose-P) 
metabolism and the activity of the enzymes which catalyse the early steps of de 
novo purine biosynthesis has been explored. It was found that hamster cells 
deficient in amidophosphoribosyltransferase did not accumulate PP-ribose-P as do 
HGPRT-deficient cells. In these model systems, an accelerated rate of de novo 
purine biosynthesis tended to be associated with an increase in cellular 
PP-ribose-P cotent, but decreases in this rate results from the reduction in the 
activity of amidophosphoribosyltransferase. Regulation of ammonia-dependent de 
novo purine biosynthesis was similar to that of glutamine-dependent purine 
biosynthesis."
"14 previously untreated patients with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa according to 
Fredrickson underwent a controlled clinical trial. The study was designed to 
clarify the effects of clofibrate on the bloodlipids. All patients were willing 
to cooperate. After leaving their usual dietary habits all of them were given 
for seven to ten days a ""prudent"" diet. This diet was rich in vitamins; it had a 
low caloric-content. 20% of the calories consisted of proteins, 35% of 
carbohydrates (sweets were omitted) and about 45% of fats with a PS-factor of 
about 2.2. After the initial dietary treatment all patients were given twice 
daily for 14 days 500 mg clofibrate. During the use of the ""prudent"" diet the 
serum-cholesterol-levels decreased in average with 14.8%. Compared to the values 
at the beginning of the trial the difference was statistically highly 
significant. The average-values of triglycerides, phosphatides and the relative 
percentage of HDL, LDL and VLDL remained unchanged. After the patients received 
clofibrate there was an additional decrease of the serum-cholesterol-values of 
14.8%. The total decrease of the cholesterol-levels compared to the initial 
values amounted to 27.4%. Furthermore, there was a reduction of the phosphatids 
in the serum of 14.1% compared to the initial value and of 9.9% compared to the 
value after dietary treatment alone. Under the combined effects of a ""prudent"" 
diet with clofibrate the HDL increased significantly. It can be assumed that 
clofibrate reduces the serum-cholesterol-levels in cases of hyperlipoproteinemia 
by decreasing the LDL-fraction, which is rich in cholesterol, and by increasing 
the HDL-fraction."
"A material of 89 cases of upper extremity deformities, among the 3225 cleft 
patients born during the period 1950-75, and treated in the Finnish Red Cross 
Cleft Centre is presented. About two-thirds of the patients had an isolated 
cleft palate--half of the male and nearly all of the female patients. The 
percentage of upper extremity deformities appearing with the different types of 
the orofacial clefts was, for clefts of the primary palate 2.0: specifically for 
cleft lip 0.8, cleft lip--palate 2.6, and cleft lip and palate 3.6; and for 
clefts of the secondary palate 3.5: specifically for cleft palate 3.7, submucous 
cleft palate 1.6; and for the branchial arch syndrome (lateral cleft) 5.2; the 
total average being 2.8 percent. About one-third of the patients were dwarfs, 
most of them diastrophic dwarfs. Syndactyly was somewhat more common among cleft 
patients, 0.3%, than in the average population. Polydactyly, 0.1% was about as 
common as the average. Ectrodactyly was more common among cleft patients, 0.4%, 
than either syndactyly or polydactyly that are considered the most common hand 
deformities among the general population. The syndactyly cases were more 
complicated than the average, among them 4 cases of Apert syndrome were noted. 
About three-fourths of the 89 patients had multiple deformities."
"Three patients are described in whom irradiation of 2750 rad or more was used in 
the management of primary brain tumours, and 21 years or more later a second 
brain tumour of a different type occurred. One of the new tumours was a 
meningioma and the other two were cerebral astrocytomas. There is evidence to 
show that moderate doses of ionising radiations given in childhood for tinea 
capitis are associated with a late risk of developing a meningioma. Higher doses 
of radiation used for tumours in childhood are followed also by a late hazard of 
meningioma. There is insufficient evidence to implicate ionising radiations in 
the aetiology of gliomas. The oncogenic hazards of radiotherapy to the brain do 
not outweigh its therapeutic value in brain tumour."
"The energy relationships between cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolism were 
studied in the hearts from euthyroid, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid rats. 
Isolated mitochondria showed high respiratory control ratios and impermeability 
to exogenous NADH. Hypo- and hyperthyroidism, respectively, resulted in lower 
and higher contents of both cytochromes per mitochondrion and mitochondrial 
protein per gram of wet weight of heart without changes in the ratio of 
cytochrome c to cytochrome aa3. In isolated perfused heart, the hyperthyroid 
state led to an increase in work rate and thereby an elevation of Vo2, which 
resulted in an increase oxidation-reduction turnover number for the cytochromes. 
An agreement was found between [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] of cytosolic free adenine 
nucleotides and the value calculated from a mathematical model of mitochondrial 
respiration. This implies that mitochondrial respiration is controlled at the 
cytochrome oxidase reaction and that oxidative phosphorylation in intact tissue 
is tightly coupled irrespective of thyroid state. It is concluded that thyroid 
hormone causes an increase in the mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial cytochrome 
content, and respiratory rate, and consequently expands the capacity of 
oxidative metabolism without an uncoupling effect on oxidative phosphorylation."
"If patients with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa are treated with diet and 
additionally over a period of two weeks with 2 grams of Clofibrate daily, the 
cholesterol-level in the serum decreases. This decrease is caused mainly by a 
reduction of the apolipoprotein B and the LDL-cholesterol in serum. If elevated 
cholesterol-levels in the serum are reduced through a ""prudent"" diet, the 
concentration of apolipoprotein B in serum remains the same. It is not fully 
understood which influence a diet, which is rich in poly-unsaturated fatty acids 
and has a low content of saturated fatty acids and carbohydrates, has upon the 
lipoproteins in the serum. The mode of action of this diet and its significance 
for the concentration of HDL need further investigation."
"The adenylcyclase (AC) activity of crude human thyroid plasma membranes were 
studied in some detail and conditions for optimal cyclic AMP-production 
established. Membranes from eight ""cold"" and two ""hot"" thyroid adenomas were 
investigated and compared to membranes from corresponding normal, paranodular 
tissues. The investigated membranes were found to contain similar basal AC 
activities, which were stimulated three to five times with TSH and 20--30 times 
with fluoride. Further, no difference in the TSH-sensitivity of AC from normal 
and ""cold"" adenomas could be detected. Thyrotrophin 0.02 mU/ml caused a 
measurable and 0.15 mU/ml a half-maximal stimulation of the cAMP-production. The 
data indicate, that disturbances of thyroid hormone production characteristic of 
thyroid adenomas, are not caused by alterations of the TSH-AC system and suggest 
that in a thyroid cell the degree of thyroid hormone synthesis do not alter the 
amount of plasma membrane-bound adenylcyclase."
"Essentially all of the Okazaki fragments on replicating Simian virus 40 
(SV40)DNA could be grouped into one of three classes. Class I Okazaki fragments 
(about 20%) were separated from longer nascent DNA chains by a single 
phosphodiester bond interruption (nick) and were quantitatively identified by 
treating purified replicating DNA with Escherichia coli DNA ligase and then 
measuring the fraction of Okazaki fragments joined to longer nascent DNA chains. 
Similarly, class II Okazaki fragments (about 30%) were separated by a region of 
single-stranded DNA template (gap) that could be filled and sealed by T4 DNA 
polymerase plus E. coli DNA ligase, and class III fragments (about 50%) were 
separated by RNA primers that could be removed with E. coli DNA olymerase I, 
allowing the fragments to be joined with E. coli DNA ligase. These results were 
obtained with replicating SV40 DNA that had been briefly labeled with 
radioactive precursors in either intact cells or isolated nuclei. When isolated 
nuclei were further incubated in the presence of cytosol, all of the Okazaki 
fragments were converted into longer DNA strands as expected for intermediates 
in DNA synthesis. However, when washed nuclei were incubated in the abscence of 
cytosol, both class I and class II Okazaki fragments accumulated despite the 
excision of RNA primers: class III Okazaki fragments and RNA-DNA covalent 
linkages both disappeared at similar rates. These data demonstrate the existence 
of RNA primers in whole cells as well as in isolated nuclei, and identify a 
unique gap-filling step that is not simply an extension of the DNA chain 
elongation process concomitant with the excision of RNA primers. One or more 
factos found in cytosol, in addition to DNA polymerase alpha, are specifically 
involved in the gap-filling and ligation steps. The sizes of mature Okazaki 
fragments (class I) and Okazaki fragments whose synthesis was completed by T4 
DNA polymerase were measured by gel electrophoresis and found to be broadly 
distributed between 40 and 290 nucleotides with an average length of 135 
nucleotides. Since 80% and 90% of the Okazaments does not occur at uniformly 
spaced intervals along the DNA template. During the excision of RNA primers, 
nascent DNA chains with a single ribonucleotide covalently attached to the 5' 
terminus were identified as transient intermediates. These intermediates 
accumulated during excision of RNA primers in the presence of adenine 
9-beta-D-arabinoside 5'-triphosphate, and those Okazaki fragments blocked by RNA 
primers (class III) were found to have originated the farthest from the 5' ends 
of long nascent DNA strands. Thus, RNA primers appear to be excised in two steps 
with the second step, removal of the final ribonucleotide, being stimulated by 
concomitant DNA synthesis. These and other data were used to construct a 
comprehensive metabolic pathway for the initiation, elongation, and maturation 
of Okazaki fragments at mammalian DNA replication forks."
"A case of carcinoid syndrome, stemming from a tumor of the large intestine with 
hepatic metastases, is reported. Clinical features included cardiac disease with 
triple valvular lesion: tricuspid insufficiency with stenosis, pulmonary artery 
stenosis and mitral insufficiency. More recent views about the pathogenesis of 
the cardiac involvement in the carcinoid syndrome are reported, and the cardiac 
therapy is discussed."
"Pyrimidine-purine DNAs with repeating sequences can be made to undergo a 
reversible transition to possibly a tetra-stranded complex. Physicochemical 
characterization of the new structures and model building are consistent with, 
in the case of d(TC)n-d(GA)n, a tetra-stranded complex forming by the addition 
of d(GA)n to the remaining space in the major groove of the triple-stranded 
complex d(TC)n-d(GA)n-d(CT)n. A possible role for tetra-stranded complexes in 
chromosome condensation is suggested by the natural occurrence of repeating 
sequence pyrimidine-purine DNAs and the properties of condensed chromosomes."
"Since experimental and clinical evidence supports some role of musculature in 
determining the form and size of facial bones during the active periods of 
growth after birth, this study addresses the same basic relationships between 
muscle and bone during the periods of active growth before birth. The 
relationship between the masseter muscle and the mandible, including its ramal 
and body components, was chosen as the model for study in nineteen human fetuses 
(ages 16 to 36 weeks). Cross-sectional cephalometric data indicated that, 
although increases in the size of the muscle and mandible were linearly related 
to increasing age, the ramal portion of the mandible was more closely related to 
changes in the masseter muscle than to changes in the mandibular body. Moreover, 
it appears that reorientation of the muscle anteriorly and downward precedes a 
similar reorientation of the ramus, with the combination of both fetal events 
leading to the typical relationships of the two structures expected after birth. 
Although this study does not get to cause-and-effect relationships, and although 
the fetal specimens cannot be monitored longitudinally over time, the 
parallelisms between our prenatal findings and those reported for postnatal 
periods certainly lend further support to the observation that many aspects of 
morphogenesis and growth are continual processes spanning the periods on either 
side of birth."
"Various methods of diagnosing allergic factors in chronic rhinitis are 
discussed. Among the procedures which aim at detecting specific allergens, i.e. 
skin testing, RAST, and nasal provocation tests, the last mentioned, as they are 
performed directly on the shock organ, have so far been found to give the most 
accurate picture of clinically dominant allergens and of the intensity and 
character of the rhinitis. However, information obtained by analysing the 
correlations between different procedures is not unanimous. As long as test 
techniques and allergen extracts have not been standardized, one particular test 
cannot be recommended as the method of choice."
"B cells that carry the complement receptor (CR+) were separated from B cells 
that lack the complement receptor (CR-) by velocity sedimentation or by passage 
through C-coated Sephadex columns. The kinetics of responses to bacterial 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in both B cell subpopulations were determined in three 
assay procedures: 1) incorporation of radioactive thymidine into DNA; 2) 
incorporation of radioactive leucine into immunoglobulin; 3) enumeration of 
cells forming polyclonal antibody to the 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl hapten. Although 
both subpopulations of B cells responded to LPS, they differed in the time 
course. CR- B cells responded with a delay of approximately 24 hr as compared 
with the response of CR+ B cells. The implications to the ontogenetic status of 
CR+ and CR- B subpopulations are discussed."
"A 12-year-old girl and a 30-year-old woman had bilateral optic disk hypoplasia 
and bitemporal hemianopia. By using computed axial tomography on our patients, 
we demonstrated the absence of the septum pellucidum, which confirmed the 
diagnosis of septo-optic dysplasia, or the de Morsier syndrome."
"Acute purulent pericarditis was treated successfully in five children between 
the ages of 27 months and 11 1/2 years during the past 5 years. The responsible 
organism was Hemophilus influenzae, type b, in two cases and Meningococcus, 
Pneumococcus, and coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus in one case each. No 
primary source of infection could be identified in two patients. A high index of 
suspicion, combined with immediate echocardiograms and pericardiocentesis, led 
to the diagnosis. Immediate antibiotic therapy was instituted on the basis of 
the gram stain of the pericardial fluid. All five patients had a pericardial 
window established--four through subxyphoid approach and the fifth, because of a 
left pleural effusion, through a left thoracotomy. When the subxyphoid approach 
was used, sump drains were left for postoperative suction and irrigation. All 
five patients survived without sequalae during follow-up periods of from 18 
months to 5 years. We advocate an aggressive approach to the diagnosis and 
treatment of this problem. This report documents the safety, ease, and 
effectiveness of the subxyphoid approach as a means of drainage."
"A case of a nine year and eight months old child with Kartagener's syndrome 
(triad) is described: chronic maxillary sinusitis, bronchiectasis and ""situs 
inversus totalis"". Literature is reviewed. It is important to understand 
genetical and etiology aspects of bronchiectasis. Diagnosis was considered on 
the basis of physical and radiographic examination."
"The effect of haloperidol and apomorphine, and both drugs in combination, on the 
first steps in the synthesis of catecholamines and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 
has been studied in three rat brain regions. The rate of formation of dopa and 
5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) was studied by measuring the accumulation of these 
amino acids during 30 min after administration of the inhibitor of the aromatic 
L-amino acid decarboxylase, NSD 1015 (3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine HCl). Haloperidol 
caused an increase in dopa and no change in 5-HTP formation. The threshold dose 
was severalfold higher in the noradrenaline-predominated hemisphere portion than 
in the dopamine-rich striatal and limbic regions, suggesting a higher affinity 
of haloperidol for dopamine than for noradrenaline receptors. Apomorphine caused 
a decrease in dopa formation in all three brain regions studied, although the 
effect was much more pronounced in the regions dominated by dopamine. The 
threshold dose was about 30 microng/kg, i.e. an order of magnitude lower than 
the threshold dose for apparent postsynaptic dopaminergic receptor activation. 
This discrepancy is suggested to be due to preferential activation of inhibitory 
dopaminergic autoreceptors by low apomorphine doses. This phenomenon may also 
contribute to explain the complex dose-response curves of apomorphine. Low doses 
of apomorphine caused a decrease and high doses an increase in 5-HTP formation. 
These effects, like those on noradrenaline synthesis, are suggested to be 
secondary to activation of dopaminergic pre- and post-synaptic receptors. The 
interaction between apomorphine and haloperidol with respect to dopa formation 
appears to be largely explicable on the assumption of a competition between an 
agonist and an antagonist for dopaminergic receptors. However, very large doses 
of apomorphine cause a haloperidol-resistant inhibition of tyrosine, and 
probably also tryptophan, hydroxylation, which may be due to a direct inhibition 
of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase involved."
"A variety of anomalies of the central nervous system are observed in trisomy 18. 
The present case describes an infant having a type II Arnold-Chiari malformation 
without spina bifida. One previous case of an Arnold-Chiari malformation was 
reported in trisomy 18 but that infant also had a lumbar meningomyelocoele. 
Abnormalities of cerebral gyration, hydrocephalus, and agenesis of the corpus 
callosum were also found in the present case."
"Cardiac arrhythmias during wakefulness and sleep in 15 patients with 
sleep-induced obstructive apnea, and the effect of atropine and tracheostomy on 
these arrhythmias were studied by continuous overnight Holter 
electrocardiographic, respiratory and electroencephalographic recordings. Sleep 
was characterized by marked sinus arrhythmia in 14, extreme sinus bradycardia ( 
less than 30 beats/minute) in six, asystole of 2.5 to 6.3 seconds in five, 
second degree atrioventricular (A-V) block in two, and ventricular 
arrhythmias--complex premature ventricular beats in 10 and ventricular 
tachycardia in two. Arrhythmias during wakefulness were limited to premature 
ventricular beats in six. Atropine administration was partially and tracheostomy 
highly effective in preventing the majority of these arrhythmias during sleep. 
Marked sinus arrhythmia during sleep is characteristic of the syndrome of 
obstructive sleep apnea and is frequently accompanied by potentially 
life-threatening tachy- and bradyarrhythmias. Possible mechanism of production 
of these arrhythmias, the mode of action of tracheostomy and atropine, and the 
probable role of similar arrhythmias in the sudden infant death syndrome are 
discussed."
"An endonuclease having EcoRI specificity is produced by bacteria containing the 
ColE1 plasmid. Such bacterial cells fail to express restriction or modification 
functions in vivo, and phage or plasmid DNA obtained from ColE1-containing cells 
has unmodified EcoRI sites that are cleaved in vitro by purified EcoRI 
endonuclease or by enzyme extracted from bacteria that carry ColE1. No EcoRI DNA 
methylase activity associated with ColE1 has been detected. The finding of 
phenotypically cryptic ColE1-dependent EcoRI endonuclease activity and the 
absence of any detectable EcoRI modification system in ColE1-containing cells 
suggest a control mechanism that appears to prevent functional expression of the 
ColE1-determined enzyme in vivo."
"It is difficult to truly define iatrogenic complications in the postsurgical 
state in that the surgery is a condition originated by physician intervention 
and thus any problems that occur may be technically considered as physician 
created. In this article we attempt to demonstrate problems that occur both due 
to technical errors and the choice of operative procedure. In addition, unusual 
postsurgical anatomy is illustrated with the hope of avoiding further iatrogenic 
problems from lack of recognition."
"Photoreaction of 4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen with superhelical ColE1 and ColE1amp 
DNA was studied. Changes in mobilities in agarose gels, formation of interstrand 
cross-links, and DNA strand breaks were determined. Psoralen and light treatment 
removed negative superhelical turns, and extensive treatments failed to produce 
positive superhelical turns in covalently closed plasmid DNA. The rate of 
relaxation of superhelical turns by psoralen Photobinding appeared to be 
directly proportional to the number of superhelical turns remaining. A unique 
reaction mechanism is presented to explain these results. By this interpretation 
the initial rate of psoralen photobinding to superhelical DNA was estimated to 
be 3 times that for linear DNA, and the ratio of cross-linking to monofuctional 
adducts appears to be dependent on the superhelical conformation of the DNA. The 
estimated ratio of psoralen molecules bound to DNA strand breaks was 1.7 . 
10(4):1, and 70% of this breakage is caused by the light alone."
"The synthesis of a series of novel bis(10-methyl)acridinium compounds (both 
unsubstituted and the 6-chloro-2-methoxy substituted) linked by methylene 
bridges of lengths from (CH2)4 to (CH2)12 and in one case by spermine is 
described. Their ability to bind to duplex DNA was compared by their relative 
inhibition of E. coli DNA polymerase catalyzed DNA synthesis. It was determined 
that they function as DNA template inhibitors and do not affect the DNA 
polymerase directly. Their ability to function as bis-intercalators was assessed 
by a novel and convenient topoisomerase fluorescent assay. It was concluded that 
whereas the (CH2)4-linked compounds act only as monofunctional intercalators 
because of steric constraints the (CH2)6-, (CH2)8-, and (CH2)10-linked 
substituted bisacridinium compounds, as well as the (CH2)10- and (CH2)12- 
unsubstituted analogues, function as bis-intercalators with DNA."
"In order to examine the permeability of microvessels in diabetic children, the 
glomerular filtration rate, urinary excretion rates of albumin and beta 
2-microglobulin, intravascular mass of albumin, and transcapillary escape rate 
of albumin were studied in 26 diabetic children without clinical signs of 
microangiopathy (age: 7-14 years; duration of disease: 3-14 years). Similar 
measurements were made in 28 healthy school children (age: 8-14 years). Mean 
glomerular filtration rate in the diabetic children was higher than in the 
normal children (138 versus 109 ml/min per 1.73 m2, p less than 0.01). Urinary 
excretion rates of albumin and beta 2-microglobulin did not differ in diabetics. 
Mean intravascular albumin mass in the diabetic girls (1.64 g/kg body weight) 
was lower (p less than 0.01) than in the diabetic boys (1.89 g/kg body weight) 
and also lower (p less than 0.02) than in the normal girls (1.94 g/kg body 
weight). Mean transcapillary escape rate of albumin in the twenty diabetics with 
duration of diabetes less than 10 years (7.14%/h) was lower (p less than 0.01) 
than that in normal children (8.90%/h); the escape rate showed a positive 
correlation with duration of diabetes (r=0.47; p less than 0.02). Thus 
glomerular filtration rate in diabetic children is elevated to the same extent 
as in adult short-term juvenile diabetics while the permeability of the 
glomerular membrane to macromolecules is normal. Interpretation of the results 
on intravascular albumin mass and transcapillary escape rate of albumin requires 
further investigation."
"1. The temperature function of the myeloma IgG(K) IVA, Bence-Jones protein 
(K-type) IVA and its fragments (Fab(t), Fc'(t), VL and CL) was studied by 
thermal perturbation difference spectroscopy and circular dichroism. 2. The IgG 
and Bence-Jones protein studied were found to be capable of a fully reversible 
structural changes at temperatures between 25 and 35 degrees C. The changes 
occurring at the higher temperature are accompanied by the screening of the 
significant part of exposed tyrosine residues. The transition is not accompanied 
by an appreciable change in the main IgG secondary structure-beta-pleated sheet, 
according to the CD data. 3. It was found that the temperature-dependent changes 
of IgG occur in its Fab fragments, the changes of Bence-Jones protein occur in 
its variable part (VL domains). 4. The temperature changes in the interval 25-35 
degrees C are explained by the flexibility of amino acid side chains composed 
hypervariable loops delineated the ""sides"" of cavity between variable domains."
"Profound iduronate sulfatase deficiency, characteristic of the Hunter syndrome, 
has been found in cultured fibroblasts, serum, lymphocytes, and tissues of two 
clinically affected girls. The patients are karyotypically normal and have 
normal fathers; cloning of the mothers' fibroblasts did not reveal the mosaicism 
expected of carriers of an X-linked disease. Homozygosity for a previously 
unsuspected autosomal recessive gene for iduronate sulfatase is considered the 
most likely explanation, although heterozygosity for the X-linked gene and 
subsequent selection cannot be completely excluded."
"A 3-year-old child diagnosed as having acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL), developed 
meningeal leukemia 36 months after the onset of the disease. He was twice 
subjected to cranial irradiation plus intrathecal methotrexate (i.t. MTX). Skull 
radiology showed bilateral gyriform calcification of both cerebral hemispheres. 
Hematological relapse was first detected 5 years after diagnosis and the child 
died 5 months later. The most striking findings of a right frontal lobe biopsy 
and the postmortem examination were wide calcium deposits located in the cortex 
and in the adjacent white matter. Intense demyelination as well as areas of 
neuron poverty were apparent in the necropsy but in the biopsy specimen. The 
possible interrelationship between such deposition and cranial irradiation 
and/or i.t. MTX suggests a new iatrogenic disorder."
"Nutritional factors in the aetiology of coronary heart disease, maturity-onset 
diabetes, diverticular disease and dental caries are discussed. Four principles 
for a prudent diet are suggested, namely: avoid excess intake of energy, 
increase dietary fibre intake, reduce total fat intake to approximately 30 per 
cent of energy intake, take a high proportion of fat as the polyunsaturated 
form."
"X-linked familial hypophosphatemic rickets (X.L.F.H.R.) is one of the D 
resistant rickets. The inheritance pattern is related to the X chromosome. Most 
constant feature is hypophosphatemia. Pathogenesis is still a subject of 
controversy. There are three main theories: a) An abnormal vitamin D metabolism. 
b) Secondary hyperparathyroidism developping as a result of the diminished 
calcium absorption by gut. c) A primary deffect of phosphate transport al 
various levels. Authors study and comment six cases of X.L.F.H.R., three of 
which belong to the same family. Clinical, radiological and higtological 
findings correspond to those of severe rickets. It is a chronic disease which 
affects children during growth period, giving rise to deforming bones 
invalidism. Treatment consists on continuous administration of oral phosphate 
and vitamin D."
"An open cross-over study of 20 patients with Parkinson's disease performed with 
two drugs containing L-dopa and a peripheral aromatic amino acid decarboxylase 
inhibitor (benserazide, carbidopa) confirmed the conclusions reached in other 
clinical trials that this combined treatment of Parkinson's disease is the most 
effective form of drug therapy available at present. With both drugs, Madopar or 
Sinemet, an optimum therapeutic result was obtained with relatively small doses 
of L-dopa (the reduction in L-dopa dosage amounting to about 80%). A loss of 
efficacy with both drugs, which has observed during long-term treatment of 
patients with Parkinson's disease, could be avoided by switching the patients 
from Sinemet to Madopar and vice versa. Determination of L-dopa in the plasma 
demonstrated that with either drug similar plasma levels of L-dopa were achieved 
during clinically effective treatment."
"Pseudodementia is the syndrome in which dementia is mimicked or caricatured by 
functional psychiatric disorders. The author describes 10 patients with 
pseudodementia and compares its clinical features with those of true dementia. 
The syndrome occurred in patients with various psychiatric diagnoses, but a 
striking feature in most patients was marked dependency. The recognition of this 
clinical syndrome should obviate the need for many neurological diagnostic 
studies and lead to earlier and more effective psychiatric treatment."
"The contrast sensitivity function of both eyes of subjects with functional 
amblyopia has been measured. A clinically significant difference was found 
between the amblyopic and the normal eye. It appears that the functionally 
amblyopic eye takes more information from the peripheral parts of the stimulus 
than does the normal eye. The sensitivity of the normal eye increases linearly 
with increasing width of the stimulus to show a knee at a certain number of 
grating lines, whereafter the sensitivity remains constant. The sensitivity of 
the amblyopic eye initially rises much faster than that of the normal eye with 
increasing stimulus width. In the amblyopic eye, there is no definite linear 
relationship between width of stimulus and the contrast sensitivity and no 
definite knee in the curve at which maximum sensitivity is reached."
"The Zieve's syndrome consists of the transient association of cholestatic 
jaundice, hemolytic anemia, hyperlipemia, in a chronic alcoholic. The Authors, 
after a short introduction regarding physiopathological problems, describe and 
subsequently examine on the clinical ground a recent personal observation, which 
had been mentioned for the rarene-s of this disease."
"Acneform lesions strictly confined to a Becker's nevus were observed in a 
18-year-old man. Histologically, a granulomatous folliculitis with partial 
destruction of the epithelial root sheath and follicular cysts with focal 
penetration of keratin into the surrounding dermis were present, ruling out acne 
vulgaris. The concept of Becker's nevus as a complex nevogenic process, 
affecting ectodermal, neuroectodermal, and mesenchymal structures, also in terms 
of dysfunction of the pilary complex, is suggested."
"The incidences of malignant melanoma recorded by 59 population-based cancer 
registries were investigated to determine the effects of racial and skin-colour 
differences. White populations exhibited a wide range of melanoma incidences and 
females commonly, though not invariably, had a higher incidence than males. 
Non-white populations experienced in general a much lower incidence of melanoma 
although there was some overlap of white and non-white rates. No predominant sex 
difference emerged among non-whites. Populations of African descent were found 
to have a higher incidence than those of Asiatic origin, but it was concluded 
that this was due largely to the high frequency of tumours among Africans on the 
sole of the foot. A clear negative correlation between degree of skin 
pigmentation and melanoma incidence emerged for the exposed body sites. These 
data provide strong support for the hypotheses that UV radiation is a major 
cause of malignant melanoma and that melanin pigmentation protects against it. 
Further research is required to elucidate the aetiology of melanoma of the sole 
of the foot."
"A study of Zika virus infections was carried out in four communities in Oyo 
State, Nigeria. Virus isolation studies between 1971 and 1975 yielded two virus 
isolations from human cases of mild febrile illness. 
Haemagglutination-inhibition tests revealed a high prevalence of antibodies to 
Zika and three other flaviviruses used. The percentages of positive sera were as 
follows: Zika (31%), Yellow fever (50%), West Nile (46%), and Wesselsbron (59%). 
Neutralization tests showed that 40% of Nigerians had Zika virus neutralizing 
antibody. Fifty per cent of zika virus immune persons had neutralizing antibody 
to Zika alone or to Zika and one other flavivirus. A total of 121 sera had 
antibody to Zika virus; of these 48 (40%) also showed antibody to two other 
flaviviruses, and 12 (10%) had antibodies to three or more other viruses. The 
percentage of neutralizing antibodies to other flaviviruses in Zika virus immune 
sera was 81% to Dengue type 1, 58% to Yellow fever, 7% to Wesselsbron, 6% to 
West Nile and 3% to Uganda S."
"Palmar stimulation was used to assess median nerve conduction across the carpal 
tunnel in 61 control patients and 105 patients with the carpal tunnel syndrome. 
With serial stimulation from midpalm to distal forearm the sensory axons 
normally showed a predictable latency change of 0.16 to 0.21 ms/cm as the 
stimulus site was moved proximally in 1 cm increments. In 47 (52 per cent) of 91 
affected nerves tested serially, there was a sharply localized latency increase 
across a 1 cm segment, most commonly 2 to 4 cm distally to the origin of the 
transverse carpal ligament. In these hands, the focal latency change across the 
affected 1 cm segment (mean +/- SD: 0.80 +/- 0.22 ms/cm) averaged more than four 
times that of the adjoining distal (0.19 +/- 0.09 ms/cm) or proximal 1 cm 
segments (0.19 +/- 0.08 ms/cm). In the remaining 44 (48 per cent) hands, the 
latency increase was distributed more evenly across the carpal tunnel. Unlike 
the sensory axons the motor axons were difficult to test serially because of the 
recurrent course of the thenar nerve, which may be contained in a separate 
tunnel. The wrist-to-palm latency was significantly greater in the patients with 
carpal tunnel syndromes than in the controls for sensory (2.18 +/- 0.48 ms v 
1.41 +/- 0.18 ms) and motor axons (2.79 +/- 0.93 ms v 1.50 +/- 0.21 ms). 
Consequently, there was considerable difference between the carpal tunnel 
syndromes and controls in SNCV (38.5 +/- 7.5 m/s v 57.3 +/- 6.9 m/s), and MNCV 
(28.2 +/- 4.5 m/s v 49.0 +/- 5.7 m/s). In the remaining distal segment, however, 
there was only a small difference between the two groups in sensory (1.48 +/- 
0.28 ms v 1.41 +/- 0.22 ms) and motor latency (2.15 +/- 0.34 ms v 2.10 +/- 0.31 
ms). The exclusion of the relatively normal distal latency made it possible to 
demonstrate mild slowing across the carpal tunnel in 36 (21 per cent) sensory 
and 40 (23 per cent) motor axons of 172 affected nerves when the conventional 
terminal latencies were normal. Sensory or motor conduction abnormalities were 
found in all but 13 (8 per cent) hands. Without palmar stimulation, however, an 
additional 32 (19 per cent) hands would have been regarded as normal."
"Investigators from this laboratory have been studying sex hormones in normal and 
autoimmune mice for the past 10 years. We have found that immune responses to 
DNa are influenced by sex hormones. Androgens reduce and estrogens increase both 
spontaneous and immunization-induced antibodies to single-stranded DNA in NZB X 
NZW, NZB X C3H, NZB X CBA, NZB X DBA mice. Treatment of female NZB/W mice with 
testosterone or 5 alpha dihydrotestosterone retards the progress of 
autoimmunity. Castration is not necessary for this effect. In contrast, danazol 
has no favorable effect on the disease process. Estrogens cause a marked 
acceleration of autoimmunity and a reduction in thymus weight. During the course 
of these studies, we found that a number of problems or variables arise in 
studying sex hormone effects, including: 1) X-linked genes, 2) metabolism of 
testosterone to estrogens, 3) dose of hormone, 4) age at which administration is 
initiated, 5) differential effects of sex hormones on different autoantibodies 
and various immune responses."
"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in culture were utilized to determine the 
cytotoxicity, specific-locus mutation induction, and DNA alkylation which result 
from treatment of the cells with a range of concentrations of 
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). With [3H]MNU over 
the concentration range 0.43--13.7 mM, methylation of DNA was found to increase 
linearly, with a mean value of 56.7 pmol residue per mumol nucleoside per mM. 
With [1-3H]ENU over the concentration range 1.7--26.8 mM, ethylation was linear, 
with a mean value of 3.8 pmol residue per mumol nucleotide per mM. Mutation 
induction at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) locus 
was quantified by determination of the frequency of resistance to 6-thioguanine 
under stringently-defined selection conditions. The mutation frequency increased 
linearly with MNU or ENU concentration (0.01--2.0 mM); mean values were 2800 and 
840 mutants per 10(6) clonable cells per mM, respectively. At equal levels of 
DNA alkylation, ENU was found to be approx. 4.5 times as mutagenic as MNU."
"The pattern of association of acrocentric chromosomes was examined in ten and 
five carriers of a 15/21 and a 13/14 Robertsonian translocation, respectively, 
and was compared with that of the same numbers of relatives with normal 
karyotypes. In the carriers of 15/21 translocation, the number of large 
associations (involving more than two acrocentrics) and the association 
frequencies for individual acrocentric chromosomes, were significantly higher 
than in the control group. The mean number of associations of the single 
homologs of the translocation chromosomes was much higher than that of the other 
acrocentrics. In the carriers of 13/14 translocations, only the association 
frequency for chromosome 13 was higher than in the normal relatives. The 
uninvolved chromosomes homologous to those involved in translocation showed an 
insignificant increase in associations in comparison with the other 
acrocentrics. These results suggest that some mechanism within the cells 
compensates for the effect of missing acrocentrics or of acrocentrics lacking 
NORs on the number of associations. The possible relations of this phenomenon to 
the activity of the nucleolus organizing regions are discussed."
"A case of pulmonary pseudolymphoma and Sjogren syndrome is presented. Unusually, 
the lung involvement preceded the salivary disease by more than two years. The 
initial gammopathy and abnormal serologies are more consistent with 
uncomplicated Sjogren syndrome, but were present when the pseudolymphoma was 
solely apparent."
"Blepharospasm is a cranial nerve dysfunction in which involuntary and 
uncontrollable forcible lid closure occurs. Surgical treatment is far from 
ideal, but the condition can be improved by sectioning the branches of the 
facial nerve plexus which supply the orbicularis oculi, the frontalis and 
corrugator muscles, and the midfacial muscles. Not all patients with 
blepharospasm should be operated upon, since they may expect too much or may 
enjoy the attention their invalidism has given them. Ectropion of one or both 
lower lids may occur, and the most severe of all complications is recurrence. 
This may happen despite a careful microscopic search for the nerve fibers and 
their division and avulsion. Blepharospasm patients often require considerable 
psychological support."
"Heat production of isolated brown-fat cells by addition of noradrenaline and 
glucagon was measured in warm-acclimated control, cold-acclimated and 
heat-acclimated rats by use of a twin-type conduction microcalorimeter. 
Noradrenaline and glucagon induced maximum heat production per 10(6) cells in 
dose of 1 microgram/ml. Heat produced by maximum thermogenic response to 
glucagon was twice as much as that to noradrenaline. Thermogenic response to 
noradrenaline was markedly increased in cold-acclimated brown adipocytes, while 
it was reduced in heat-acclimated ones. Thermogenic response to glucagon was 
significantly reduced in heat-acclimated brown adipocytes, while it was not 
affected in cold-acclimated brown adipocytes."
"Forty-five patients with aneurysms of the anterior cerebral artery distal to the 
anterior communicating artery were operated on by a direct approach method in 
the years 1960-1973. The incidence of aneurysms in this location was 4.8% of the 
total 1,000 aneurysms. It is of upmost importance in the treatment of aneurysms 
to insure the parent artery for the purpose of temporary occlusion. This makes 
it easier and safer to approach the aneurysmal neck and to handle possible 
premature aneurysmal rupture. From this technical standpoint, the aneurysms in 
this location were classified into two types, ascending and horizontal. 
Aneurysms of the pericallosal artery between the origin of the anterior 
communicating artery and the knee of the corpus callosum were designated as the 
aneurysms of the ascending portion, whereas the aneurysms of the pericallosal 
artery from the knee of the corpus callosum and beyond were designated as the 
aneurysms of the horizontal portion. Depending on the location of the aneurysm, 
craniotomy was performed at one of two different sites. For aneurysms of the 
ascending portion, bifrontal craniotomy was determined and applied as the safest 
approach. A small parasagittal craniotomy was determined to be sufficient for 
aneurysms of the horizontal portion. Although the total operative mortality was 
4 of 45 cases (9.0%), no mortalities nor morbidities occurred in the last 12 
cases since 1972, when the sites of craniotomies were differenciated."
"Triiodothyronine (T3) toxicity has been well documented in adults, but only 
isolated cases have been reported in children. Two girls presented with firm 
goitres and overt hyperthyroidism. In each patient, total serum thyroxine (T4) 
values by competitive protein binding were normal, however total T3 values by 
radioimmunoassay were elevated. One patient had Graves' disease, the second 
patient had Hashimoto's disease which has been only infrequently associated with 
T3 toxicity in adults. Both patients responded to therapy with propylthiouracil. 
The mechanisms by which T3 is preferentially secreted in thyrotoxic states in 
man are poorly understood, but iodine deficiency and poor iodination of 
thyroglobulin may be important factors."
"The usefulness of blood enzyme determinations as markers of liver necrosis was 
tested in 100 alcoholics who underwent biopsy during clinical investigation. 
Mean values of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), serum aspartate and alanine 
transferase (SGOT and SGPT), ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OCT), and 
gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma-GTP) tended to rise with increasing liver 
cell necrosis, though values of SGOT, SGPT, OCT, and gamma-GTP showed 
considerable overlap between the 32 patients with histologically proved 
hepatitis and the 68 without. By contrast, GDH values showed virtually no 
overlap between patients with and without hepatitis, and a value of two and a 
half times the normal value discriminated between the two groups. Because of its 
easy determination and its reliable reflection of liver cell necrosis the GDH 
concentration should be estimated routinely in alcoholic patients."
"Previous experiments to separate the amylase and ""invertase"" of honey by 
chromatography on sephadex-gels were unsuccesful. It was shown that 
honey-amylase, -like amylases form other sources -- has hydrophobic properties. 
Therefore it was possible to separate amylase-activity from other activities by 
means of hydrophobic affinity chromatography on phenyl-butylamine-Sepharose 4B."
"Serum lipids and thyroxine were determined in 26 men participating in a 90-km 
cross-country ski race, before, immediately after, and on the following days. 
Serum cholesterol was unchanged immediately after the race, but then fell 
significantly and remained low during the observation period. During the race 
the fatty acid composition of serum free fatty acids changed towards the 
composition of ordinary adipose tissue. The compostiion of serum triglycerides 
showed similar but less pronouced changes. On the following days an increase in 
the arachidonic, and a decrease in the linoleic acid fraction of the total serum 
lipids were observed. Total thyroxine and free thyroxine in serum were 
significantly increased at the end of the race, but had returned to the 
pre-raced levels during the rest of the observation period. The observations 
correspond to the findings during acute, severe illness, and are compatible with 
the hypothesis that some of the changes in serum lipids following severe somatic 
stress are due to increased thyroid hormone activity."
"Dose-response studies have been performed to investigate the effect of thyroid 
hormones on insulin secretion from the rat pancreas with special reference to 
the time course of the hormone effect, doses of triiodothyronine (T3) and 
thyroxine (T4), and glucose concentration in the perfusion medium. The prominent 
effect of thyroid hormones was the inhibition of the late phase of 
glucose-induced insulin secretion. As the late phase comprises at least 98%-99% 
of insulin released from the pancreas during a 60-min stimulation period with 
glucose, 60-min cumulative values were calculated. Both T3 and T4 inhibited 
insulin secretion and induced concomitant inhibitory effects on plasma 
cholesterol levels, a parameter of experimental hyperthyroidism. The correlation 
demonstrates that inhibition of glucose-induced insulin secretion from the 
pancreas is a specific effect of thyroid hormones. The inhibitory effect of T3 
was five times greater than the inhibitory effect of T4. An excess of thyroid 
hormones induced hyperthyroidism, with its well-known increased incidence of 
diabetes."
"The authors describe a case in which transcatheter embolization was used to 
treat a large arteriovenous malformation of the scalp (cirsoid aneurysm), with 
subsequent development of multiple aneurysms at the embolization sites. This 
previously unreported complication may have far reaching implications in 
treatment modality selection."
"The initial phagocytic rate of IgG coated polyvinyl toluene latex particles was 
assayed for isolated PMN cells. The kinetic studies of phagocytosis were 
performed in serum-free medium using an electronic particle counter. The mean 
phagocytic rate for the reference group of apparently healthy individuals was 
0.60 min-1. PMN cells from 5 of 26 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) had 
subnormal values of particle ingestion rate, although the mean of the group was 
not significantly reduced compared to the controls. Correlation coefficient 
between the log of rheumatoid factor titer and phagocytic rate was 0.58 (P less 
than 0.001). During penicillamine treatment an increased rate of phagocytosis 
was observed in patients with RA. Granulocytes isolated from 17 patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) had a significantly increased (P less than 
0.001) mean initial rate of phagocytosis (0.91 min-u). Two patients in this 
group had an acute exacerbation of disease activity and were treated with large 
doses of prednisone. An appreciable decline in phagocytic rate was observed 
during the intensive corticosteroid therapy."
"After having described in detail the pathophysiology, symptomatology, 
X-chromosomal inheritance and some laboratory methods in detecting 
G-6-PD-deficiency by demonstrating a case of favism (Schulz et al. 1977), the 
authors now discuss the particularities of the enzyme deficiency in the newborn. 
These are complicated by additional physiological and transient deficiency of 
the enzymes catalase, NAD-diaphorase, glutathione peroxidase, and glucuronyl 
transferase. Several chemical substances, acidosis, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and 
immaturity may cause a severe hyperbilirubinemia in G-6-PD-deficient newborns. 
The development of a kern-icterus in these cases may be prevented by early 
exchange transfusion. From clinical findings and some observations in different 
regions of Greece an additional factor influencing the liver function has been 
postulated which favors the development of hyperbilirubinemias in 
G-6-PD-deficient newborns. The nature of this possible factor is discussed. The 
authors emphasize the necessity of screening for G-6-PD-deficiency during 
pregnancy in families of mediterranian descent."
"Thermoplasma acidophilum, a thermophilic mycoplasma, has several unusual 
features suggesting a possible relationship to eukaryotic cells. One feature is 
a histone-like protein that is associated with the DNA, condensing it into 
subunits similar to those in eukaryotic chromatin. A second feature is an 
association of cytoplasmic proteins that resembles eukaryotic actin and myosin. 
These two components are widely distributed in different groups of eukaryotic 
cells, but are typically lacking in prokaryotic cells. Furthermore, T. 
acidophilum lacks cytochromes and respires by enzymes that apparently are not 
coupled to oxidative phosphorylation. This primitive type of respiration 
resembles that of microbodies, another feature which is represented in the 
cytoplasm of all groups of eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, since T. acidophilum 
lacks a cell wall and appears to have a primitive correlate of endocytosis, it 
would appear to be mechanically capable of acquiring a symbiotic mitochondrion. 
Thus, our observations are consistent with the symbiotic hypothesis for the 
origin of eukaryotic cells. We suggest that an organism similar to T. 
acidophilum was the host cell for the original symbiosis, becoming the nucleus 
and cytoplasm of modern eukaryotic cells."
"Estimates of the newborn frequency of cystic fibrosis in different Caucasian 
groups range from 4 times more to 40 times less common than the generally 
accepted figure of 1:2000. Current meconium screening trials which may be 
effective in populations with the incidence equal to or greater than 1:2000, may 
be useful for populations with an incidence as low as 1:7000 only after maximum 
improvement of the methods. Once the true incidence or the variable incidence is 
proven for Caucasian populations, screening trails in Negro, Oriental and Indian 
populations will be required."
"There are many procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms in plant kingdom. It is 
hoped that the study of plant histones will be useful in evolutionary studies. 
The histones of great variety of animal species have been studied and well 
characterized. Less information is available concerning plant histones. The 
general conclusion drawn from these investigations is that most organisms of 
eucaryotic plant and animal species contain the same five major histone 
fractions. Recently the histone-like proteins were found in some primitive 
eucaryotes and procaryotes. Data on histones from higher and lower eucaryotes 
and histone-like proteins of procaryotes are reviewed. Evolution of histones and 
their appearance prior to that of eucaryotic cell is postulated. The role of 
histones in evolution of nucleosomes is discussed."
"Twenty-one patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have been on a gluten free 
diet regularly followed up for at least one year (mean four years). Eighteen 
patients had a 'flat' mucosal appearance (grade III), one patient had moderately 
severe mucosal abnormality (grade II), one patient had mild mucosal abnormality 
(grade I), and one patient had a normal mucosal appearance (grade O). On the 
diet, 10 patients had no skin rash and took no dapsone, seven patients 
controlled the skin rash on a lower dose of dapsone, and four noticed no 
improvement. There was no correlation between pre-diet jejunal morphology and 
response of the skin. A repeat jejunal biopsy, on the gluten free diet, was 
possible in 15 patients. While all those with skin improvement showed some 
improvement in jejunal morphology, there was no association between the degree 
of skin improvement and the degree of recovery of the jejunal mucosa."
"Seven women in three generations of a family have been affected by Turner 
syndrome. Turner phenotype in this family is the result of deletion of the 
entire short arm of one X chromosome. The short arm deletion is transmitted by 
carriers of a balanced X-1 translocation. Autoradiographic findings showed that 
the deleted X chromosome was late labeling in those persons with Turner 
syndrome, whereas the normal X chromosome was late replicating in carriers of 
the balanced translocation. The results of Xga typing of erythrocytes suggest 
that the Xg locus is on the short arm of the X chromosome. Because of the 
clinical implications, we believe that families of persons with structural 
chromosomal abnormalities should be studied to exclude familial transmission."
"Four amphipathic drugs, primaquine, propranolol, chlorpromazine and tetracaine, 
were used to cause endocytosis in glucose-depleted red cells, and the relative 
reduction of membrane surfaces was measured by the toluidine blue (TB) method. 
The TB measurements correlated well with the observed electron microscopic 
alterations. In vitro blood storage studies indicated loss of cell membrane 
during storage correlated with decreasing uptake of TB by the red cells. 
Regeneration of cellular ATP with adenosine did not always restore TB uptake by 
the cells. Loss of red blood cell membrane either by exocytosis or endocytosis 
may occur during normal in vivo or in vitro ageing, and may be increased in 
pathological states or by the action of drugs."
"PUVA therapy successfully cleared various dermatoses mainly confined to the 
palms and soles in 18 of 20 patients treated. The conditions treated were: 
plaque-type psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, endogenous eczema and persistent 
palmoplantar pustulosis. Seventeen patients were treated in a controlled study 
of PUVA therapy versus no treatment at all and in 16 of these patients the 
disease was cleared in the PUVA-treated areas while the untreated areas remained 
unchanged or deteriorated. Twelve of the 18 patients were maintained in a clear 
state by continued maintenance PUVA treatment over 6--31 months while 3 patients 
had a spontaneous remission and are free of disease off all treatment."
"Forty-six cases of basilar skull fractures in children were reviewed to 
determine the incidence of CNS infection following injury and the possible value 
of antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis. The clinical course of the children who were 
treated with antibiotics was compared with that of patients who received no 
antimicrobial therapy. Included in the study were patients with hemotympanum 
alone or with hemotympanum plus additional clinical or roentgenographic signs of 
basilar skull fracture; patients with tympanic membrane perforation without 
otorrhea but with blood in the auditory canal; and children with either otorrhea 
or rhinorrhea. Acute, delayed, or recurrent infection of the CNS did not develop 
in any of the patients. This study is the first of its kind presented in 
children. It would seem on the basis of the present series that the systematic 
use of antibiotic prophylaxis in children with hemotympanum following basilar 
skull fractures is unwarranted and that children with other signs of basilar 
skull fractures may have an equally small risk of meningitis following injury."
"During the late stage of adenovirus 2 infection, RNA chains are initiated at a 
site near coordinate 16 (Evans et al., 1977) and transcribed approximately 
30,000 nucleotides to the far end of the genome at coordinate 100. Late mRNAs 
processed from these transcripts contain a common spliced tripartite leader 
(Berget, Moore and Sharp, 1977; Chow et al., 1977a) encoded at approximately 16, 
20 and 27, and protein coding sequences which map downstream. This report maps 
the late promoter and the capped 5' end of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs from 
this transciption unit, and analyzes their structures. We show that nascent RNA 
chains pulse-labeled in vivo are initiated at coordinate 16.5 +/- 0.5 and 
contain the sequences intervening between the leader segments. We map the capped 
5' terminus of late nuclear transcripts at a site between 16.4 and 16.6 by 
aligning T1 RNAase oligonucleotides from nuclear RNA with the DNA sequence of 
the promoter region. The structure of the first eleven residues of the capped 5' 
terminus of late mRNA was determined by direct RNA sequencing. This structure 
corresponds exactly to a DNA sequence at coordinate 16.4 and precisely positions 
the mRNA cap template within the promoter region. These results suggest that the 
promoter and the cap template sites are coincident, and that the initiating 
residues of the primary transcript are precursors of the capped 5' end of mRNA. 
Residues removed from transcripts by splicing were identified. These plus caps 
were detected in large polyadenylated nuclear RNA, indicating that capping and 
polyadenylation can occur on unspliced molecules. Residues retained in the mRNA 
first leader contain a nine residue sequence adjacent to the cap which is 
complementary to the 3' end of 18S rRNA, suggesting that the first leader 
functions in ribosome binding. Nucleotide sequences from the promoter region are 
compared with cellular counterparts. Strong homologies at cap sites and splice 
points suggest that for the noted cases, the virus and cell share closely 
related mechanisms for mRNA 5' end synthesis and splicing."
"1. Decapped tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA and rabbit globin mRNA were prepared 
by enzymic treatment of RNAs with nucleotide pyrophosphatase purified from 
potato. The extent of removal of 5'-terminal 7-methylguanosine 5'-monophosphate 
(m7GMP) from TMV RNA was at least 97% as estimated by labeling of the 5' termini 
in vitro with S-adenosyl[methyl-3H]methionine catalysed by vaccinia virus 
methyltransferases. 2. The effect of enzymic decapping was compared with the 
effect of cap analogs on mRNAs translation in a nuclease-treated rabbit 
reticulocyte lysate and in a wheat germ extract. When translation was studied at 
low K+ concentration, little or no dependence on 5'-terminal 7-methylguanosine 
was found with either cell-free system. The importance of the 5'-terminal cap 
for the efficient translation of TMV RNA and globin mRNA increased as the 
concentration of K+ in a protein-synthesis system was raised. In a reticulocyte 
lysate analogs and enzymic decapping had a similar effect on translation. In a 
wheat germ extract, mRNA decapping resulted in a more pronounced decrease of 
mRNA activity, presumably due to the increased susceptibility of decapped mRNAs 
to the nucleases present in this protein synthesis system. 3. The requirement 
for a 5'-terminal cap was similar for the synthesis of 130,000-Mr and 165,000-Mr 
polypeptides coded by TMV RNA. This indicates that both proteins may be 
initiated at the common site close to the 5' terminus."
"Necrobiosis lipoidica is a skin disorders with an interesting predisposition for 
areas of trauma such as the anterior shins. In this report a patient with 
diabetes mellitus and generalized necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum with 
localization in surgical scars is described. A brief review of other skin 
disorders occurring in scars is also included."
"The activity of the pituitary hormones (ACTH, STH, TTH, FSH, LH), the adrenal 
hormones (cortisol, aldosterone), the kidney hormone (renin), and the thyroid 
hormones (thyroxine tri-iodthyronine), the thyroxine binding capacity of blood 
proteins and the activity of the hormones of the pancreas (insulin) and the sex 
glands (testosterone, estradiol) were studied in 26 males suffering from 
ischemic heart disease verified by means of selective coronarography and in 20 
healthy males with no atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries of the heart. 
Patients with ischemic heart disease were found to be marked by increased 
activity in the blood of ACTH, TTH, cortisol, aldosterone, insulin, and 
estradiol and reduced concentration of STH, thyroxine, and testosterone. These 
shifts in the activity of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal system and in its 
subordinate hormonal systems play an important role in the origin of the 
atherosclerotic process and assosiated ischemic heart disease."
"Twenty-four hours after a tetracycline injection, the unimpeded, and more 
rapidly erupting, mouse mandibular incisor contained 20% to 44% more 
tetracycline than the contralateral, uncut incisor. It was concluded that the 
increased tetracycline incorporation reflected a higher rate of mineralization 
associated with faster tooth formation in the unimpeded tooth. By measuring the 
amount of tetracycline which became incorporated at different times after an 
incisor was shortened, it was possible to investigate an early stage of the 
response of the incisor to cutting. A significant increase in the capacity of 
the tooth to incorporate tetracycline was detectable 4 h after shortening the 
tooth, and this was maximal after another 4 h."
"A patient with combined deficiency of erythrocyte glucose phosphate isomerase 
(GPI) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is presented. The propositus 
has persistent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. One of his two brothers exhibits 
the same rare enzymatic defect, but without any clinical symptoms. The 
electrophoretic pattern of GPI showed GPI type 1. There seems to be a 
correlation between the unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and the combined 
enzymopathy in our patient."
"Mouse malignant teratocarcinoma cells, upon injection into early embryos at the 
blastocyst stage, become integrated into the developing embryo and stably 
normalized. In the mosaic mice that are formed, tumor-derived cells can give 
rise to the full range of normal, functional somatic tissues, and also to germ 
cells from which progeny are obtained. Totipotent mouse teratocarcinoma cells 
thus provide a new and essentially parasexual means of generating entire 
animals. The advantages of in vitro and in vivo technologies can now therefore 
be combined to synthesize mice with experimentally useful mutations. After 
mutagenization of the teratocarcinoma cells in culture, and selection or 
screening for the desired mutant phenotype, cells of mutant clones are 
microinjected into genetically marked blastocysts for further differentiation 
and full gene expression within the framework of the organism. An example is the 
isolation, by 6-thioguanine resistance, of cells deficient in 
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase -- the same deficiency that 
characterizes human patients with the X-linked Lesch-Nyhan disease. In work in 
progress, these cells have been cycled into genetically marked blastocysts, 
where the tumor lineage has successfully given rise to fully differentiated 
tissue contributions in which the enzyme defect persists. Such experiments 
present numerous possibilities for introducing specific mutations into mice, 
toward the ends of studying gene mechanisms responsible for differentiation and 
of producing animal models of human genetic diseases. Teratocarcinoma cells may 
also serve as vehicles for introducing foreign genetic material into mice in 
order to facilitate analyses of gene control mechanisms in development and 
disease."
"Fifty-eight patients with Wilson's disease are reviewed, of whom 25 symptomatic 
patients experienced liver disease first and 28, brain disease. Ten of these 
patients presented with liver disease alone, 19 with brain disease alone, and 24 
with evidence of both liver and brain disease. The remaining five were 
discovered as asymptomatic siblings of known patients. Three of the patients 
with hepatic presentation and one with neurologic presentation later experienced 
the other type of symptomatology, bringing the total number of patients with 
mixed disease to 28. Of the 44 patients with brain disease, 12 presented 
primarily with extrapyramidal findings, 6 with cerebellar findings, and 17 with 
both; pseudobulbar findings were noted in 9 patients, all of whom had other 
symptoms of severe nervous system disease. In addition to these presentations, 
in an appreciable number of patients the first symptoms were of a mental or 
emotional disorder. Disease of other organ systems, such as the joints and 
kidneys, also occurred but infrequently. Where adequate family information was 
available, 13 of 65 siblings (20%) were known to have had or were suspected of 
having had Wilson's disease. This is consistent with the autosomal-recessive 
pattern of inheritance."
"For half a century the systolic click and late systolic murmur lay dormant as 
innocent auscultatory curiosities. The thirteen years since Barlow related these 
phenomena to mitral leaflet prolapse have witnessed an astonishing information 
explosion. We have sought to bring together the accumulated data in this review. 
An Historical Perspective traces the evolution from the now abandoned 
""pericardial"" or ""extracardiac"" phases, through the leafletchordal phase 
(redundancy), the myocardial phase (segmental left ventricular contraction 
abnormalities), to the anular phase (dilatation and faulty systolic 
contraction). Functional Anatomy is dealt with in terms of pathology, 
pathophysiology, hemodynamics, angiocardiography, echocardiography, and physical 
and pharmacological interventions. Clinical Manifestations are concerned with 
prevalence, natural history, symptoms, physical signs, electrocardiographic 
abnormalities and roentgen fingings. The four Major Complications- sudden death, 
infective endocarditis, spontaneous rupture of chordae tendineae, and 
progressive mitral regurgitation- are examined. Associated Cardiac Diseases, 
i.e., Marfan's syndrome, ostium secundum atrial septal defect and 
atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, are discussed, and a section on 
Treatment deals chiefly with prophylaxis for infective endocarditis and the 
management of arrhythmias and chest pain. A final section on Evolving 
Information considers etiologic concepts, the nature of left ventricular 
contration abnormalities, the cause of chest pain, the relationship to Marfan's 
syndrome and ostium secundum atrial septal defect, and the effect of aging and 
sex differences on leaflet chordal redundancy."
"Virological and serological methods were used in examination of 28 patients 
suffering from subacute thyroiditis de Quervain. Attempts to isolate a presumed 
viral agent from 8 patients were performed by inoculation of serum, urine, and 
aspiration biopsies of thyroid glands taken at different stages of the illness, 
into tissue cultures of different types of human and animal cells. Recovery of a 
cytopathic viral agent on cells of a rabbit lung continuous line was successful 
in 5 cases. Serological cross reactions exist between the isolated viruses and 
patient serum but not with serum of healthy people. Cases with the acquired 
illness and positive antibodies against the isolated viruses who had been in 
close and prolonged contact with patients suffering from subacute thyroiditis de 
Quervain were also investigated."
"When observed in the electron microscope intact gas vesicles appeared as 
transparent areas in whole cells of Microcylus aquaticus, whereas vesicles 
collapsed by centrifugation were not discernible. Within 5 min of suspending 
cells containing collapsed vesicles in growth medium, small transparent vesicles 
were detected. By 15 min the average number of vesicles per cell was 15. This 
number remained relatively constant while the size of the vesicles increased 
until they attained their maximum diamtere of 100 nm. At this time the vesicles, 
interpreted as biconical structures, began to elongate presumably due to the 
synthesis of the cylindrical midsection. Closely correlated with the time at 
which vesicles began to elongate was the initiation of smaller vesicles which 
resulted in a doubling of the number of vesicles per cell by 90 min. This 
evidence coupled with the isolation of a mutant which assembles only the conical 
portions of the vesicle suggests that assembly occurs in two distinct stages 
subject to genetic mutation. Protein and ribonucleic acid synthesis, and 
presumably adenosine triphosphate formation, were required for gas vesicle 
assembly. In addition, inhibition of protein or ribonucleic acid synthesis 
resulted in a loss of extant gas vesicles. Over the time course of our study, 
deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was not required for gas vesicle assembly or 
stability."
"It was shown in the passive hemagglutination test (PHAT) with a type-specific 
somatic antigen on 147 carriers of toxigenic diphtheria bacilli that the PHAT 
titres of 1/80 and over were determined in 64% of bacteria. In the process of 
carrier state of toxigenic bacteria antimicrobial antibodies were detected in 
79% of the children; after the release from the carrier state, the percentage 
was from 57 to 26, depending on the time lapse after it. Among the carriers of 
nontoxigenic diphtheria bacilli the PHAT titre of 1/80 and over was established 
in up to 20% of children, and only in those which were in the focus of toxigenic 
bacilli carriers. The applied test could be used for epidemiological purpose to 
determine the spread of the carrier state of toxigenic bacteria in a collective 
body."
"In a survey in Israel of 50 patients with Wilson's disease, it was found that 
this disease occurred in all ethnic groups. In the Arab patients there was a 
significantly early age of onset and the disease followed a more severe course 
than that in the Jewish patients. The overall sex ratio of patients was nearly 
1:1, and genetic analysis of 20 families confirmed an autosomal recessive mode 
of inheritance. The very similar age of onset and type of disease within 
sibships and the varying ages of onset noted between the Arab and Jewish 
patients suggest that the disease is genetically heterogeneous."
